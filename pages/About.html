        <p>Iâ€™m Ange Ingabire. but you can call me Malayika.</p>
        <p id="aboutMsg">I took a period of 6 months coding,<br>
            I've been developing Mobile applications and websites<br> 
            using mostly android and HTML,CSS and Javascript.<br>
            and I'm taking Andela Technical Leadership Program with Andela<br>
            I do this for a living and love what I do as every day<br>
            there is something new and exciting to learn.<br>
            In my spare time, the software development community<br>
            is a big part of my life.<br>
            taking ATLP in Andela, I find keeping involved helps me stay up to date.<br>
            Besides programming I love spending time with friends and family<br>
            and can often be found together going out catching the latest movie,<br>
            occupying the kids at any event or planning a trip to somen place I've never been before.<br>
